 10. Asynchronous programming    

 Asynchronous means that you can execute multiple things at a time and you don't have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to next one.       

You are in a restaurant with many other people. You order your food. Other people can also order their food, they don't have to wait for your food to be cooked and served to you before they can order. In the kitchen restaurant workers are continuously cooking, serving, and taking orders. People will get their food served as soon as it is cooked.        

11. Synchronous programming     

Synchronous basically means that you can only execute one thing at a time.     

You are in a queue to get a movie ticket. You cannot get one until everybody in front of you gets one, and the same applies to the people queued behind you.
